make_home_dir:
--------------

make_home_dir is a small program, that creates the home-directory of
the calling user, if it does not exists.
This is useful for machines, where you want to create home-directorys
in the moment, where users want to login.
Normally you would use the PAM module pam_mkhomedir, but since version 3.6
of SSH, a new security model, called privilege separation is used, while
authenticating a user. pam_mkhomedir can not work with privilege violation,
because in this phase, SSH is in a chrooted environment.

To get around this, I created this small program.
It can be called by any user and will only create the home-directory of
the calling user. To do that, make_home_dir has only to run under a privileged
GID, that has write-permission to the parent-directory of the home-directory.


INSTALLATION:
-------------

Do the following, to setup your system:
add a group named 'home' (home is only a recommendation, you can use any
group-name you want to):
    $ groupadd home
Now make the parent of the home-directories writeable to this group:
(in this example /home)
    $ chgrp home /home
    $ chmod g+w /home

Install the make_home_dir:
    $ make
    $ make install

Put the call in /etc/profile (or /etc/login for csh,tcsh)
A better place would be /etc/profile.d/makehomedir, if your
distribution supports /etc/profile.d/

Examples in profile.d directory
